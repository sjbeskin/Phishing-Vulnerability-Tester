# Phishing-Vulnerability-Tester WIP
This application is a mock program intended for companies to test which of their employees are susceptible to phishing scams.
## What is the need for this?
It's becoming more and more important in the digital age to protect sensitive information online. Because so much critical data is available on the internet, scammers are constantly getting better at stealing digital information. This makes it absolutely essential that people are cautious and informed about the threats online. This Phishing Vulnerability Tester is intended for companies to send phishing emails to their employees to track who is vulnerable to these sorts of scams so they can be educated on how better to protect themselves.
## What does it do?
Phishing Vulnerability Tester allows a systems administrator to sign into their company directory and send believable, premade phishing emails requesting login information. The program then flags that user as having clicked on the email and lists out all flagged employees for the sys admin to see.
## Requirements
- A directory of employees from Azure or Google
- One or more email addresses from which to send the phishing emails
- A web server from which to host the phishing site
